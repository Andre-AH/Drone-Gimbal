# Drone Camera Gimbal Project

## Description

This project was developed in FreeCAD and consists of a gimbal assembly designed to support a drone camera. The gimbal provides stabilization during flight, allowing for high-quality image and video capture.

## Project Structure

The folder contains the following files:

- **Parts**: Various individual files for the components of the gimbal.
- **Assembly**: The assembly file that combines all the parts of the gimbal.
- **.stl Model**: The exported file in STL format.
- **Rendered Images**:
  - **gimbal_rendered.png**: Rendered image of the gimbal alone.
  - **gimbal_with_plane_rendered.png**: Rendered image of the gimbal attached to a plane.

## Acknowledgments

The model of the plane used in the rendered images was created by **Spid2r2**. You can find more details about the plane model on [GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com/library/ry_x9a-1).

## Instructions for Use

1. **Open in FreeCAD**: To view and edit the parts, open the assembly file in FreeCAD.
2. **Customization**: Feel free to modify the model as per your needs.
